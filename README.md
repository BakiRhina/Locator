# Consistency in Query-based Meeting Summarization

 Our project is inspired by an article authored by Microsoft, "QMSum: A New Benchmark for Query-based Multi-domain Meeting Summarization". This paper introduces a comprehensive dataset designed to train models to perform query-based multi-domain meeting summarization. The authors suggest several potential avenues for future work, particularly focusing on improving the consistency between the generated summaries and the corresponding queries, as determined by the reference summaries. Therefore, our primary objective in this project is to enhance this consistency.
